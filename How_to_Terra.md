## Creating a Terra Account and Linking NIH Credentials

### Important Requirements
To create a Terra account that can be linked to NIH credentials, **you cannot use a Google email address** (e.g., `xxx@gmail.com`). Instead, you must set up your Terra account using a non-Google email address, such as your NIH email.

### Step 1: Create Your Terra Account
Follow the detailed instructions at this link:

https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029186611-How-to-set-up-a-Terra-account-with-a-non-Google-email

**Key Point:** When creating your Google account during the setup process, select **"Use your existing email"** instead of creating a new Gmail address.

### Step 2: Log Into Terra and Link Your NIH Account
Once your account is created, follow these steps:

1. **Log into Terra:** 
   - Navigate to `https://anvil.terra.bio/`
   - Click the `Sign In` button
   - Select `Sign in with Google`
   - Log in using the account you created in Step 1

2. **Access your profile:**
   - Go to the main navigation menu by clicking the three horizontal lines at the top left of any Terra page
   - Click on your name to expand the menu, then select **Profile**

3. **Navigate to External Identities:**
   - Click on the **EXTERNAL IDENTITIES** tab

4. **Link your NIH account:**
   - Click the button to log into NIH under **External Identities**
   - You'll be redirected to an external authentication webpage
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to link your accounts

5. **Verify the connection:**
   - Once successfully linked, you'll see a link expiration deadline displayed

```
